The CanberraUAV Image Processing (cuav) tools are designed to quickly and
accurately locate objects of interest from a large set of photos. With the addition
of flight logs of geo-tagging, it can also give the location of the objects.

It can be run in realtime directly from a camera, or offine from a folder of images.

The tools can be run on both Linux and Windows platforms.

Cuav was created by `CanberraUAV <http://canberrauav.org.au/>`_ as part of the 
`UAV Challenge <https://uavchallenge.org/>`_, in order to find a missing
bushwalker from photos taken by a Unmanned Aerial System (UAS, commonly known as a "drone")
as it flew over the search area at low altitude.
