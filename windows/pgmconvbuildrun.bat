rem This builds and runs geotag.py
rem It is useful as a quick build-n-run for debugging changes to cuav
rem This assumes Python is installed in C:\Python27
rem   If it is not, change the PYTHON_LOCATION environment variable accordingly
rem This assumes InnoSetup is installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5
rem   If it is not, change the INNOSETUP environment variable accordingly
rem This requires the MinGW compiler and libjpeg-turbo development files (libjpeg-turbo-1.5.1-gcc.exe)
rem also requires pyexiv2 - https://launchpad.net/pyexiv2
